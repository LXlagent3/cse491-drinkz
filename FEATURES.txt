Student A wants to go to a party which require each one to bring their own wine.
He goes to the official website of the specific party to get some ideas of others.
Unfortunately, the average drink rating for the party is way
above any of those in his drink history and the price he could afford.
So, student A needs to keep searching the party page for a more
acceptable party to go to.
Party page should display the basic info such as time location, total number of people 
registered, rating by table. Also it should include the info of the alcohol such as price 
and level.
